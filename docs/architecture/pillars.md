# Product Pillars & UX Outcomes (1-pager)

## Pillars

- **Path**: Clear, motivating progression with units, checkpoints, and mastery states.
- **Gamification**: Lightweight, meaningful feedback (XP, streak, energy) that rewards consistency.
- **Brand**: Friendly, confident, and encouraging tone with playful micro-interactions.

## Success Metrics

- **DAU lesson starts**: +X% week-over-week
- **Path progress**: median lessons completed per session
- **Retention**: D1/D7 lesson-start retention, monthly streak holders

## Celebratory UX Guidelines

- **Moments**: Lesson complete, checkpoint pass, streak milestones, XP level-ups
- **Effects**: Confetti burst (respect `prefers-reduced-motion`), sparkles, subtle haptics (mobile)
- **Tone**: Short, affirmative phrases; avoid overloading with dialogs
- **Constraints**: Keep celebrations under 1.5s; always provide a clear next action
